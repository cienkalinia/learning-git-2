				<p>Coming out to the light of day
				We got many moons than a deeper place
				So I keep an eye on the shadow's smile
				To see what it has to say
				You and I both know
				Everything must go away
				Ah, what do you say?
				Spinning off, head is on my heart
				Zmiana tekstu w innym branchu</p>
				
				<p>Yeah, you don't know my mind
				You don't know my kind
				Dark necessities are part of my design
				Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
				Dark necessities are part of my design</p>
				
				<p>Stumble down to the parking lot
				You got no time for the afterthought
				They're like ice cream for an astronaut
				Well that's me looking for weed
				Turn the corner and
				Find the world and show command
				Playing the hand</p>
				
				<p>Yeah, you don't know my mind
				You don't know my kind
				Dark necessities are part of my design
				Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
				Dark necessities are part of my design</p>
				
				</p>Do you want this love of mine?
				The darkness helps to sort the shine
				Do you want it, do you want it now?
				Do you want it overtime?
				The darkness helps to sort the shine
				Do you want it, do you want it now?</p>

				<p>Pick you up like a paperback
				With the track record of a maniac
				So I'm moving in and we unpack
				It's the same as yesterday
				Honey where we roll
				Everything must go away
				Ah, what do you say?
				Yeah, you don't know my mind
				You don't know my kind
				Dark necessities are part of my design
				Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
				Dark necessities are part of my design
				Ah-ah-ah
				Ah-ah
				Ah-ah-ah
				Ah-ah</p>

				<p>Do you want this love of mine?
				The darkness helps to sort the shine
				Do you want it, do you want it now?
				Do you want it overtime?
				The darkness helps to sort the shine
				Do you want it, do you want it now?</p>
