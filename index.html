				Coming out to the light of day
				We got many moons than a deeper place
				So I keep an eye on the shadow's smile
				To see what it has to say
				You and I both know
				Everything must go away
				Ah, what do you say?
				Spinning off, head is on my heart
				It's like a bit of light and a touch of dark
				You got sneak attacked from the zodiac
				But I see your eyes spark
				Keep the breeze and go
				Blow by blow and go away
				Oh, what do you say?
